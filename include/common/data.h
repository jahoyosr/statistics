/**
 * @brief Function to print the statistics of an array including maximum, minimum, mean and median.
 *
 * This function takes in two input arguments: a pointer to an array of unsigned char values and the 
 * size of the array. The function then iterates through the array to determine maximum, minimum, media, 
 * and median values. Once all the statistical properties have been calculated, the function prints them 
 * to the console. 
 *
 * @param array_pointer Pointer to the array of unsigned char values.
 * @param array_size    Size of the array.
 *
 * @return void.
